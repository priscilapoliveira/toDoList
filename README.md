# ðŸ˜¸ About the project

Rocketseat challenge. Create a to do list where the creation of a user with name and user name will be allowed, as well as making the CRUD of all:

- Create a new *to do*;
- List all *to do*;
- Change the `title` and `deadline` of an existing *to do*;
- Mark an *to do* as done;
- Delete a *to do*;

All this for each specific user (the `username` will be passed in the header). Below we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€
